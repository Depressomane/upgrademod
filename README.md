# ValkyRiver: upgrademod [WIP]
**upgrademod** is a [Balatro](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2379780/Balatro/) mod by ValkyRiver which allows every item in the Collection to be upgraded (except for decks, but there are 3 new decks)

This mod is currently only half-complete and is still a work-in-progress project.

Also, this mod has only be tested on 1.0.0~ALPHA-0813a-STEAMODDED.

### Current Progress:
• Most Jokers have upgrades

• All consumables have upgrades

• All enhancements, editions, and seals have upgrades

• All vanilla booster packs have upgrades

• All Tags have upgrades

• All Vouchers have upgrades 

• Higher-level blinds have higher scoring requirements

• All bosses are affected by blind level (and Chicot / Luchador)

• There are 3 new decks: Level 2 Deck, Level 3 Deck, and Level 4 Deck

• A separate tab to view current upgrade levels

• All implemented items (I think) have modified descriptions

• Collection tabs have a "level select" UI

### Yet to be completed:
• Jokers: Blueprint, Brainstorm

• Custom items used for upgrading elements from the game during a run

## Upgrade categories
In this mod, the items in the Collection are split into 14 categories:

• +Mult Jokers

• XMult Jokers

• Chips Jokers

• Econ Jokers

• Effect Jokers

• Tarot Consumables

• Planet Consumables

• Spectral Consumables

• Enhancements

• Editions/Seals

• Booster Packs

• Tags

• Vouchers

• Blinds

After the addition of custom items is completed, the first 13 categories can be upgraded during a run. Higher-level blinds can only be found by using the Level 2, Level 3, or Level 4 decks. Some items (mostly items with non-numerical effects) have a maximum effective level, where upgrading the item to anything higher doesn't make a difference. Other items can be scaled indefinitely by upgrading them.

## Known bugs

• Cerulean Bell doesn't function properly when exiting and reentering a run

## Potential compatibility issues due to overwriting (yet to be resolved)

• There is a lot of overwriting in this mod, mostly because Steamodded overwrites all of the files in the "functions" folder (so using lovely.toml doesn't work)
