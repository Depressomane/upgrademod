# ValkyRiver: upgrademod [WIP]
**upgrademod** is a [Balatro](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2379780/Balatro/) mod by ValkyRiver which allows every item in the Collection to be upgraded (except for decks, but there are 3 new decks)

This mod is almost complete now. Only a bit of testing left.

This mod has been tested on 1.0.0\~ALPHA-0813a-STEAMODDED and 1.0.0\~ALPHA-0919a-STEAMODDED.

### Current Progress:
• All Jokers have upgrades

• All consumables have upgrades

• All enhancements, editions, and seals have upgrades

• All vanilla booster packs have upgrades

• All Tags have upgrades

• All Vouchers have upgrades 

• Higher-level blinds have higher scoring requirements

• All bosses are affected by blind level (and Chicot / Luchador)

• There are 3 new decks: Level 2 Deck, Level 3 Deck, and Level 4 Deck

• A separate tab to view current upgrade levels

• All implemented items have modified descriptions

• Collection tabs have a "level select" UI

• There are 13 new "Upgrade" items, each of which upgrades one kind of item in the collection

• Within a run, one can pick up the "Choose an Upgrade" item, where one can choose between three different upgrade items (Note: If you have not used an upgrade in this Ante, then this item is guaranteed to appear on the shop before the Boss Blind)

• Custom music while in the "Choose an Upgrade" item (Music by ValkyRiver)

### Yet to be completed:
• Do some test runs on the Level 2, Level 3, and Level 4 decks at various stakes

## Upgrade categories
In this mod, the items in the Collection are split into 14 categories:

• +Mult Jokers (Common upgrade)

• XMult Jokers (Common upgrade)

• Chips Jokers (Common upgrade)

• Econ Jokers (Common upgrade)

• Effect Jokers (Common upgrade)

• Tarot Cards (Uncommon upgrade)

• Planet Cards (Uncommon upgrade)

• Spectral Cards (Uncommon upgrade)

• Enhancements (Uncommon upgrade)

• Editions and Seals (Rare upgrade)

• Booster Packs (Rare upgrade)

• Tags (Rare upgrade)

• Vouchers (Rare upgrade)

• Blinds (Deck only)

The first 13 categories can be upgraded during a run by choosing an upgrade using the "Choose an Upgrade" item. Higher-level blinds can only be found by using the Level 2, Level 3, or Level 4 decks. Some items (mostly items with non-numerical effects) have a maximum effective level, where upgrading the item to anything higher doesn't make a difference. Other items can be scaled indefinitely by upgrading them.

## Known bugs

• Cerulean Bell doesn't function properly when exiting and reentering a run

• Drawing Negative playing cards in a booster pack can occasionally cause hand size to be reduced in the next blind

## Potential compatibility issues due to overwriting (yet to be resolved)

• There is a lot of overwriting in this mod, mostly because Steamodded overwrites all of the files in the "functions" folder (so using lovely.toml doesn't work)
